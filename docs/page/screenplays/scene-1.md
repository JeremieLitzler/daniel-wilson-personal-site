BLACK.

JOY (V.O.){.character}

Do you ever look at someone and wonder, “What is going on inside their head?” Well, I know. I know Riley’s head.{.character-talking}

WHITE. FADE IN...

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

A newborn baby swaddled in a blanket, held by her parents.

Push in... and ZOOM IN TO HER HEAD.{.p-with-no-margin}

INT. HEADQUARTERS

Out of the blackness steps a glowing figure. This is JOY. The
room is black except for a bright CONSCIOUSNESS SCREEN.

JOY{.character}

Hmm?{.character-talking}

In front of Joy is a single large BUTTON. She pushes it.

INT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

The baby gurgles and wiggles happily.

JOY (V.O.){.character}

And there she was...{.character-talking}

INT. HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

ON THE CONSCIOUSNESS SCREEN:

MOM{.character}

Hello, Riley.{.character-talking}

DAD{.character}

Oh look at you. Aren’t you a little bundle of joy?{.character-talking}

A GOLDEN GLOWING SPHERE rolls from behind the screen. It’s a MEMORY of what we just saw: Mom and Dad cooing at Riley.
